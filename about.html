            <p>We are the members of the team "Cosmic Stars" who developed "Explanore," a web-based educational platform that simplifies the complex topic of exoplanets for middle and high school students. This project addresses the challenge of making exoplanet science more accessible by offering interactive data visualizations, animated storytelling, and a gamified learning experience. It transforms technical concepts into engaging, easy-to-understand content that keeps students involved through exploration and quizzes. This tool is important because current resources on exoplanets are often too technical for younger audiences, hindering their understanding of astronomical discoveries. By leveraging real-time NASA data and interactive design, our project bridges this gap, fostering curiosity and enhancing science education for future generations.</p>
