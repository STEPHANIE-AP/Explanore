            <p>Exoplanets come in various types, including terrestrial (rocky), gas giants, and ice giants. They can be found in different environments, such as those orbiting stars similar to our Sun, or those orbiting red dwarfs, which are cooler and smaller than our Sun. The search for exoplanets has led to exciting discoveries, including potentially habitable worlds.</p>
