            <h2>1. Proxima Centauri b</h2>
            <p>Proxima Centauri b is an Earth-sized exoplanet located in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, about 4.2 light-years away. Discovered in 2016, it has a mass approximately 17% greater than Earth and orbits its star every 11.2 days. While it is potentially rocky and located within the habitable zone, its proximity to Proxima Centauri may expose it to intense radiation, making the presence of a stable atmosphere uncertain.</p>

            <h2>2. TRAPPIST-1e</h2>
            <p>TRAPPIST-1e is one of seven Earth-sized planets orbiting the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, located about 39 light-years away. It is situated in the star's habitable zone, where conditions may allow for liquid water. With a mass similar to Earth's, TRAPPIST-1e is considered a prime candidate for studying the potential for life beyond our solar system.</p>

            <h2>3. Kepler-186f</h2>
            <p>Kepler-186f is the first Earth-sized exoplanet discovered in the habitable zone of another star, located about 500 light-years away. It orbits a star smaller and cooler than the Sun, with a year lasting 130 days. This planet has a radius 1.1 times that of Earth, suggesting it may have a rocky composition and the potential for liquid water.</p>

            <h2>4. Luyten b</h2>
            <p>Luyten b is a super-Earth located around 12.2 light-years from Earth in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Luyten's Star. With a mass about 2.9 times that of Earth, it is believed to be rocky and may have conditions suitable for liquid water. Its proximity to its host star makes it a strong candidate for future studies on habitability.</p>

            <h2>5. Ross 128 b</h2>
            <p>Ross 128 b is an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting the nearby red dwarf star Ross 128, approximately 11 light-years away. Discovered in 2017, it is located within the habitable zone, where conditions could allow for liquid water. The planet is tidally locked, meaning one side always faces its star, which raises questions about its atmospheric dynamics.</p>

            <h2>6. Gliese 581g</h2>
            <p>Gliese 581g is a super-Earth located in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star Gliese 581, about 20 light-years away. It has a mass approximately 3.1 to 4.3 times that of Earth, making it a prime candidate for habitability studies. However, its existence has been debated due to the limitations of detection methods.</p>

        <section id="teegarden-b">
            <h2>7. Teegarden b</h2>
            <p>Teegarden b is an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting the M-type star Teegarden's Star, located around 12.5 light-years from Earth. Discovered in 2019, it lies within the star's habitable zone and has a mass about 1.1 times that of Earth. Its proximity and potential for liquid water make it a compelling candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
