            <p>Exoplanets come in various types, including terrestrial (rocky), gas giants, and ice giants. They can be found in different environments, such as those orbiting stars similar to our Sun, or those orbiting red dwarfs, which are cooler and smaller than our Sun. The search for exoplanets has led to exciting discoveries, including potentially habitable worlds.</p>
            
            <h2>Proxima Centauri</h2>

            <p>Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun, about 4.2 light-years away in the Alpha Centauri system. As a red dwarf star, Proxima Centauri is much smaller and cooler than our Sun, with a temperature of around 3,100 kelvins. It is classified as a flare star, known for its bright solar flares, including the largest flare ever recorded in 2019.

            <h3>Planets Orbiting Proxima Centauri</h3>
            <p>Three planets are thought to orbit Proxima Centauri: Proxima Centauri b, c, and d. Proxima Centauri b, discovered in 2016, is about 17% more massive than Earth and lies within the star's habitable zone, where liquid water could exist. However, its proximity to the star may hinder its ability to support life.</p>
            <p>Proxima Centauri c is a super-Earth that, if it exists, may be far too cold to support life, with temperatures near −233 °C (−388 °F). The existence of Proxima Centauri c has been debated due to potential issues in the discovery methods.</p>
